# Diskey PDF generator
We don't have to lie, LaTeX sucks 🤮.

1. You have to install a library for everything you want to do.
2. You can't just place things the way you want on your page
3. To install LaTeX on your laptop, you have to do it the old way.

So I made a simple PDF generator with it's own language, Diskey 🎉🥏.
