# Diskey

We don't have to lie, LaTeX sucks 🤮.

1. You have to install a library for everything you want to do.
2. You can't just place things the way you want on your page
3. To install LaTeX on your laptop, you have to do it the old way.

So I made a simple PDF generator with it's own language, Diskey 🎉🥏. 

## Gettings started

All you need to do is download the [latest version](https://github.com/l0uisgrange/diskey/releases/latest/) ⚡️. There is no need to install TeX, LaTeX or any other software.

### Requirements

Diskey requires macOS Sonoma 14.0+, and works in the following languages :
- 🇫🇷 French
- 🇬🇧 English
- 🇮🇹 Italian
- 🇩🇪 German
